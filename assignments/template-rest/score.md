- **+100** REST service is implemented using framework/library differs from Express and Nest.js or pure Node.js

## Forfeits

- **-200** Changes in tests or workflow
- **-150** Full link to repsitory differs from https://github.com/%your-gihub-id%/nodejs2021Q4-service
- **-30% of max task score** Commits after deadline (except commits that affect only Readme.md, .gitignore, etc.)
- **-30** No separate development branch
- **-30** No Pull Request
- **-30** Pull Request description is incorrect
- **-10** Every lint error after npm run lint using local config (errors, not warnings) 
- **-30** Less than 3 commits in the development branch, not including commits that make changes only to `Readme.md` or similar files (`tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, `.prettierrc.json`, etc.)
